# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object-state or behavior(instance) of a class
* class-blueprint (code) that defines how to create an object.
* instance-specific realization of any object.
* method-a collection of statements, in a class used to manipulate (mutators) or acess (accessors) information from an ojbect of that class. (Behaves like a function in math)
* signature-name of the method and the type of parameter. I.E, the following signature changes the size of the instance "box" of class "box" and does not give an output.
* parameter-an input of the method. I.e "box" is the parameter in the example above. 
* type-defines what values the parameter is allowed to be.
* state- Set of values describing the object.
* source code- collection of written commands that compiles to create an excutable program..
* return value-output of method
* compiler-transforms source code into computer language

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0-int, double, float
* "hello"-string
* 101-int, double, float
* -1-int, double, float
* true-boolean
* "33"-string
* 3.1415-double, float

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
To add a new field, you would have to add a parameter.
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
void send(String param);

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
int average(int firstParam, int secondParam);
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class. 
The book i am reading is an object of a class.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
An object  can have only one class but can implement many interfaces.
