# Lab 02 -- Chapter 01

## Define the followint terms:
* object-"object" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
* class-Is a program code to create objects.
* instance-propertys and behaviors of categorys of things
* method- set of code which is called by name. It is like a subprogram.
* signature-the method name and the number and type of its parameters
* parameter- is a special variable, it's a value that is passed to a routine.
* type- a classification identifying one of various types of data
* state-is a term where it holds all the stored information, and at a given instant in time, to which the circuit or program has access.
* source code- is human constructions written using human-readable computer language.
* return value-is a statement that tells a function to return execution of the program to the calling function, and report the value of exp .
* compiler-special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language

## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0-int
* "hello"-string
* 101-int
* -1-int
* true-boolean
* "33"-string
* 3.1415-double

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?
To add a new field, you would have to add a parameter.
## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.
void send(String param);

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.
int average(int firstParam, int secondParam);
## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class. 
The book i am reading is an object of a class.

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.
An object  can have only one class but can implement many interfaces.
